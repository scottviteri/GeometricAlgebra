# Geometric Algebra Project

This project involves the implementation and testing of geometric algebra operations in Python. It also includes equivalent test cases in SageMath, in case you have that installed.

## Files

- `src/ga.py`: This file contains the main implementation of the geometric algebra operations.
- `tests/test_normal_form.py`: This file contains the test cases for the geometric algebra operations written in `ga.py`.
- `src/ga.sage`: This shows an example of how to use geometric algebra symbol manipulation in sage, in case you have the sage executable (different from the  python executable) installed locally

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
pytest --collect-only
```
